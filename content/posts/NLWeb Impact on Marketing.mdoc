# **The Agent-First Web and the Rise of NLWeb: Optimising for the Future of AI Interfaces**

By Rishan Chopra

The internet is undergoing a foundational transformation. With the emergence of Microsoft’s **NLWeb**, we are entering the age of the **agent-first web** — where AI agents become the dominant interface between users and the digital world.

---

## **What is NLWeb?**

NLWeb is an **open-source initiative** that empowers websites to communicate in natural language through conversational interfaces. It builds on widely adopted formats like **Schema.org** and **RSS**, integrating them with the capabilities of **large language models (LLMs)**.

### **NLWeb Enables:**

- Natural language querying of site content\
- AI-native interfaces layered onto websites\
- Machine-readable presentation of services and products\

**Analogy:** NLWeb is to AI agents what HTML was to web browsers — a protocol for discovery, interaction, and representation.

## **Why the Agent-First Web Matters**

Traditionally, SEO meant optimising content for **search engines** and **blue link rankings**. But AI agents—like Google’s SGE, ChatGPT, and Microsoft Copilot—don’t just return links. They summarise, recommend, and act.

In this world, metadata becomes:

- \**Visible and actionable\**
- \**A primary determinant of brand representation\**
- \**The interface through which decisions are made on your behalf\**

**Insight:** In the agent-first web, traffic is routed via decisions made by AI—not by users clicking links. That means **optimising for agents** is now a strategic imperative.

## **The Rise of Agent Experience Optimisation (AXO)**

At Adgent, we believe the next wave of digital strategy is **AXO** — Agent Experience Optimisation.

### **AXO Requires:**

- Enriching metadata across all digital assets\
- Structuring product and service data for discoverability\
- Monitoring how AI agents summarise, interpret, and relay brand information\

**AXO is to agents what SEO was to search.**

## **Practical Steps for Brands**

To prepare for this paradigm shift, brands should begin optimising now:

1. **Audit Metadata**: Ensure your product/service pages use up-to-date Schema.org markup.\
1. **Deploy NLWeb Protocols**: Start experimenting with NLWeb templates for key pages.\
1. **Structure Content for Agents**: Focus on clarity, hierarchy, and semantic richness.\
1. **Monitor Agent Representations**: Use tools to track how your brand appears in AI summaries.\
1. **Iterate on Agent Feedback**: Treat agent responses like you would SEO performance data.

## **Final Thought: Metadata Is the New Message**

The agent layer is becoming the **new digital battleground**. In this world:

- \**Agents are the interface\**
- \**Metadata is the message\**
- \**AXO is the strategy\**

Brands that adapt early to this shift will not only maintain relevance but gain strategic edge. The future isn’t just about being found — it’s about being represented *accurately and advantageously* by AI.
