# **Mastering Google's AI Mode: How Query Fan-Out Changes SEO Forever**

By Rishan Chopra

Google’s recent launch of **AI Mode** at Google I/O marks a significant milestone, reshaping the landscape of search. Powered by **Gemini 2.5**, AI Mode leverages advanced multimodal and conversational capabilities, fundamentally shifting SEO strategies by focusing on context rather than individual queries.

## **What is Google AI Mode?**

AI Mode enhances Google's Search Generative Experience (SGE), employing a novel **query fan-out technique** to deliver comprehensive, context-rich answers. Instead of addressing queries linearly, AI Mode breaks complex user questions into multiple sub-queries simultaneously.

### **Google explains query fan-out:**

"AI Mode breaks down your question into subtopics and issues multiple queries simultaneously, diving deeper into the web to find hyper-relevant content matching your query."

---

## **How Does Query Fan-Out Work?**

Query fan-out expands a single user query into several parallel sub-queries, each targeting specific intents or related aspects. This approach:

- Captures multiple user intents simultaneously\
- Retrieves broader and deeper insights\
- Integrates content from diverse sources (web, knowledge graph, Google Shopping)

### **Example: Bluetooth Headphones Query**

A user searching for:

“Bluetooth headphones with a comfortable over-ear design and long-lasting battery”

would trigger fan-out queries exploring facets like:

{% table %}
---
- **Facet**
- **Example Sub-Query**
---
- General product discovery
- “Best Bluetooth headphones with over-ear design”
---
- Comfort-focused
- “Most comfortable over-ear Bluetooth headphones”
---
- Battery performance
- “Bluetooth headphones with longest battery life”
---
- User experience
- “User reviews of Bluetooth over-ear headphones”
---
- Comparison by brand
- “Sony vs Bose vs Sennheiser Bluetooth headphones”
{% /table %}

The resulting AI Mode answer includes:

- Recommended products with reasoning\
  \
- Summaries of specifications, comfort, and battery life\
  \
- Sources prominently linked, increasing transparency and credibility

## **Implications of AI Mode for SEO**

AI Mode’s query fan-out significantly impacts SEO in several critical ways:

### **1. Deeper Intent Understanding**

- SEO moves beyond single keywords to addressing **entire user journeys**.\
- You must anticipate related sub-questions users might have and optimise accordingly.

### **2. Comprehensive Topical Authority**

- Build clear **topic clusters** around core themes to showcase your expertise.

### **3. Anticipating Follow-Up Questions**
