# **SEO vs. AEO: How to Adapt Your Strategy for the AI-Driven Search Era**

By Rishan Chopra

The digital landscape is shifting dramatically from traditional search engines to AI-driven Answer Engines like ChatGPT, Google's SGE, and Perplexity. To stay relevant, brands need a clear understanding of **Answer Engine Optimisation (AEO)** and how it differs from traditional SEO.

## **What is Answer Engine Optimisation (AEO)?**

AEO involves optimising content so brands, products, or services appear accurately and favourably in AI-generated responses provided by platforms like ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Google's AI Overviews.

## **Why is AEO Important?**

AI Answer Engines synthesise content dynamically rather than returning ranked lists, significantly impacting how brands gain visibility. By 2026, Gartner forecasts a **25% drop in traditional search volume** as users increasingly rely on AI-generated responses.
