## What Is Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)?

**Answer Engine Optimization** is the practice of structuring and formatting content so that it can be easily discovered and used by AI-powered answer engines. Unlike traditional SEO, which is keyword-driven and focused on ranking in search results, AEO aims to provide **direct, semantically-rich answers**.

### Examples of Answer Engines:

- ChatGPT
- Google Search Generative Experience (SGE)
- Microsoft Bing Copilot
- Amazon Alexa
- Apple Siri

## Why AEO Matters

### 1. Conversational Search

Users are increasingly asking full-sentence questions, and AI systems need well-structured, semantically clear answers.

### 2. Zero-Click Results

More searches end without a click as users get answers directly on search pages. AEO helps your content *be* the answer.

### 3. Machine Understanding

AI engines extract meaning from structured, entity-rich content—not just keywords.
